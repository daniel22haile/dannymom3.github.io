    <h2>My professional goals!</h2>
    <p>When I came to Seattle, I completly changed my mind about my professional goals. I want to be a good software developer. The reason why I want to be a software developer is because of I'm a big fan of technology and I want to know something new in
        every activity of my life.</p>
    <h2>My passion!</h2>
    <p>My biggest <em><strong>passion</strong></em> is helping people as much as I can and see smiling on their face because that makes me smile too more than anything I do. Sometimes I enjoying myself by watching any kind of sport events like soccer or
