/*
If you wanted to remove the array length 'k' from function parameter, you can read the array length inside the function and assign it to 'k'. Your algorithm is looks good for unsorted array. If it is for sorted array you can remove one loop from your algorithm as shown in below. In below algorithm, I have used same input array to store the final output. So returning final index value 'j' of output array (After removing duplicates).

Refer this link for detailed analysis: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remove-duplicates-sorted-array/

Algorithm RemDup(arr[0..n-1])

k<--arr.length
j<--0

for i<--0 to i<k do    
  if arr[i]!=arr[i+1]then
  arr[j] = arr[i]
  j<--j+1
  end if
endfor
 Store the last element as whether it is unique or repeated, it hasn't stored previously

    arr[j] = arr[n-1];  
return arr,j
