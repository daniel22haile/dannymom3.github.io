A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with 
references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). 
In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.

In JavaScript, closures are the primary mechanism used to enable data privacy. 
When you use closures for data privacy, the enclosed variables are only in scope within the 
containing (outer) function. You can't get at the data from an outside scope except 
through the object's privileged methods.
