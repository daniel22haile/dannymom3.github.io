In JavaScript, a method is:
            => a function that belongs to an object or stored in the object properties.
            => an action that can be performed on objects 

Everything in JavaScript is an object 
            => a function is an object 
            => an Array is an object.

When we write our code using objects to represent entities, that’s called object-oriented programming, 
in short: “OOP”.

Functions and methods are the same in JavaScript, but a method is a function, which 
is a property of an object.


functions are methods in Javascript. There is no difference. 
Essentially the answer is NO, not all functions are methods in JavaScript. 
In the above example, add is a function and since it belongs to myMathObject , that
 makes it also a method.
