In JavaScript, a method is:
            => a function that belongs to an object or stored in the object properties.
            => an action that can be performed on objects 

Everything in JavaScript is an object 
            => a function is an object 
            => an Array is an object.

When we write our code using objects to represent entities, that’s called object-oriented programming, 
in short: “OOP”.
