Final Exam Preparations

The final exam will focus on (but not necessarily be limited to) the material on inheritance and classes.
For your own learning and long term retention of the course material I highly recommend that you review:
 * morning quiz questions and answers (they should all be available to you in Sakai)
 * slides and readings on inheritance and classes, especially red and yellow highlighted slides
 * bank and score exam exercises from homeworks and first two exams
 * clock exercises from last homework
 * consider all of the following points "red" for the final exam


what is the value of this ?
 - in a method
 - in a function (in global scope)
 - in an inner function
 - in an arrow function
 - in a constructor function ***
 - in a class constructor
 - in a class method
 - when used with inheritance
   -- methods shared, but not state (generally)
   -- object before dot  
 
be able to transform between class and constructor function and object literal implementations
  -- e.g., the quiz questions from the w4d2 ckquiz
  
draw object diagrams as in class

call, bind, apply

function User(name){
  console.log("1:" , this);
  this.name = name;
  console.log("2:" , this);
  }
tina = {};
const thisUser = User.bind(tina);
thisUser("Rujuan");
thisUser("Tina");
console.log("3: ", tina);
