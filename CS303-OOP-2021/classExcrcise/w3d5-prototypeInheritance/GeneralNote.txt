#primitives on native prototypes

==>Values null and undefined have no object wrappers
     Special values null and undefined stand apart. 
     They have no object wrappers, so methods and properties are not available for them. 
     And there are no corresponding prototypes either.


#Changing native prototypes
Native prototypes can be modified. For instance, if we add a method to String.prototype, it becomes available to all strings:

String.prototype.show = function() {
  alert(this);
};

"BOOM!".show(); // BOOM!
