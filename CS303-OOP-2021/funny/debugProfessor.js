/**
 * This program is to find learning bugs if there are some.  It is natural law that you want to learn 
 * something, you must be able to learn. In the Bible "seek and you will find ", it means that if I am 
 * seeking for understanding JS,  I should find the understanding. STC: When knowing occurs, there are 
 * knower and the known. Why knowing and knower are here, but missing the known. Here must be a bug, 
 * a learning bug. Finding the bug is the purpose of this program.*/
