    <h2>About me!</h2>
    <p>My name is <strong>Daniel Haile.</strong> Originally, I'm from <em>Ethiopia,</em> located on horn of Africa, in east of the continent. When I was a high school student, my dream was to be an engineer. After I completed a high school, I joined to Addis
        Ababa university, Ethiopia, five years bachelor degree programe for civil engineering. After graduation, I got a chance of U.S. diversity visa lottory. I moved to <em>Washington, Seattle in 2017.</em></p>
    <p>When I came to Seattle, I completly changed my mind about my professional goals. I want to be a good software developer. The reason why I want to be a software developer is because of I'm a big fan of technology and I want to know something new in
        every activity of my life.</p>
